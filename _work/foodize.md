      <h2>It all began with hunger</h2>
      <p>One hungry afternoon my coworkers and I were trying to decide where to eat for lunch. It took us at least 15 minutes of throwing around a dozen places only to result in being unable to choose where before we finally ended up eating. I thought to myself, “There’s gotta be an easier way”—that’s when I thought up Foodize.</p>

      <p>It was important to make Foodize accessible on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I designed for mobile, then scaled up to fit desktop.</p>
