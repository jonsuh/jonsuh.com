Since starting [100 Days of Scriptures](/100-days-of-scriptures/), several people have asked me about it. As it comes to an end, I’d like to share its story, the process, lessons learned, and the effect its had on me.

## Inception

It was July, and I was in search for a side project, but not “just another side project.” I wanted it to be challenging, personal and close to my heart.

- I’m a web developer, and I love design.
- I’m a Believer, and I love the Scriptures.

If I could find a unique way to intersect design with the Scriptures, and showcase it on the web, it would fit within the scope of what I was looking for.

## Purpose

I want the things I do to have purpose, meaning and significance. The older I get, the more I realize the importance of words like “deliberation,” intent,” and “motive.” I wanted this project to encompass them. I wanted [100 Days of Scriptures](/100-days-of-scriptures/) to:

1. Magnify God and His words.
2. Bring to life, accentuate, and provide a unique perspective on the Scriptures and message behind each verse or passage.
3. Encourage and uplift those that could use a Spiritual boost from the Scriptures.
4. Bring to light God‘s love, mercy, grace, forgiveness, etc.
5. Offset the skewed perception of those that only know/see God by His judgment and wrath.
6. Help people, particularly Christians, see the importance of design and the impact that good design can have.

## Expectations and Specifics

I set some realistic expectations for myself before getting into the project. I wanted it to:

- Be a challenge, but not be something that would steal chunks of time away from my day, especially from family and sleep.
- Require commitment, but not something that would burn me out or want me to bail before finishing.
- Be more a “want to” than a “need to“—if I was going to spend a significant amount of time and effort, I wanted to enjoy it, not resent it.

I enjoy designing, and appreciate good design and typography, but I’m not a great designer (I’m more of a developer, anyway). I chose code and typefaces as my medium and the web as my platform so the project felt closer to home.

I came across [The 100 Day Project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days), a collaboration by [Elle Luna](http://elleluna.com) and [The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com), earlier this year and thought 100 days would be a good span of time.

That’s when I decided, “**1 verse/passage of Scripture, every day, for 100 days.**”

- A different passage/verse of Scripture for each day.
- A different design for each day.
- Typefaces from [Google Fonts](https://google.com/fonts).
- No images—only code.

## Preparation

I spent the next few days building my local development environment and the front-end architecture of the site. I wanted each day to look consistent but be modular to allow for custom designs.

With 66 books, 1,189 chapters, and 31,102 verses in the Bible, surely I could come up with 100 verses/passages. I gave myself a head start by making a list of 25 of my favorite parts of Scripture. I even asked my friends on Facebook for their favorites (I ended up ditching their suggestions—I explain [why](#takeaways) later).

100 unique designs!? If I know anything about design, it‘s that anything worthwhile takes time. But I had already committed and began the work, so I put aside my excuses and gave myself some breathing room by creating a few designs ahead of time.

## <del>100</del> 108 Days

I launched 100 Days of Scriptures on my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday. In spite of the fact that I was done with my 20’s, I was excited for day 1 and the 99 days that remained. The designs I had created as a buffer didn’t last long. By the end of the first week, I was all caught up and designing something new each day.

Coding and shipping a new design every day is rewarding, but tough. I didn’t have a strict process for creating each design; instead, I went with the flow. Sometimes design ideas came naturally, while other times I had to work at coming up with them. I also let the time I spent on each design be loose. Some evenings (more than not), my pillow called my name, and I was eager to get the design out the door and in bed. Then there were other evenings where I was in the zone and willing to experiment, and when I was done, I had invested 3–4 hours. However, after I had delivered a design, done was done. I didn’t invest more time the next day adjusting and perfecting yesterday’s design—it was hands off and on to the next day.

In total, I missed 8 days so far due to travel, sickness, sleepiness and personal reasons. I made up for those days, which extends the length of the project to 108 days. My longest streak was 41 days.

Other fun facts:

- Average time designing and coding per day: 1.5 hours
- Longest day: [Day 26](/100-days-of-scriptures/#day-26) at 4 hours (Day 36 comes in 2nd at 3.5 hours)
- Shortest day: [Day 38](/100-days-of-scriptures/#day-38) at 30 minutes
- Favorite day: [Day 71](/100-days-of-scriptures/#day-72)
- Favorite font: [Playfair Display](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display) (Used 5 times)
- Favorite verse: Proverbs 16:3, [Day 100](/100-days-of-scriptures/#day-100) (My life verse)

## Takeaways

Design comes less naturally to me, which required me to flex muscles I don’t flex as often to deliver a design every day. Looking back, I am proud of some of the designs, but there are plenty I wish I could refine or nuke and redo. However, the project was less about design, typography and CSS, and more about character, intent, discipline and execution. I’m thrilled I went the distance and about to cross the finish line.

I hoped this project would be an encouragement and inspiration to others, but as time went by, I began realizing that the person that needed this project most was me. I embraced that notion and made adjustments to how I approached each day. I ditched my friends’ Scripture suggestions and began searching the Scriptures on my own every day.

This one, intentional move had the greatest effect on me. The project became personal on a new level. It was now ministering to me and helped me be more personal and intentional in my relationship with Christ.

It’s been amazing to couple my God-given gifts and passion with God’s Word to package them up into this project. I’m not a pastor or a missionary, but I am a developer/designer. I believe design, the web and efforts like this can help communicate the truth behind the Scriptures and the Gospel, and 100 Days of Scriptures was one way I could contribute to eternal things.

### THANK YOU!

Unfortunately, I have no plans to extend it past 100 days, but to cap it off in a positive way, I’ve open sourced it on [Github](https://github.com/jonsuh/100-days-of-scriptures).

I enjoyed and benefited much from it, but 150 hours (probably closer to 200) is an investment, and I’m ready to invest my time into something else. I have considered bringing it to life in print (posters, maybe a book?), but I’m unsure—It was designed for the web, and putting it into print isn’t as easy as copy-and-paste. If you have any thoughts or input, feel free to [reach out](/contact/), or follow me on Twitter [@jonsuh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh) if you want to stay in the loop.
