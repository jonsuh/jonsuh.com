Spend less time fiddling with keys when unlocking your door; instead, unlock your door with an app on your smartphone; better yet, have it unlock as you’re walking up to it. August Smart Locks allows you to do just that. Well... sometimes.

I got my August Smart Lock in October 2014 and have been using it ever since. I love it, and I hate it. So what’s there to love and hate? Here’s my first-hand review of August and my 3 months of using it.

## Installation and Setup

August Smart Lock is dead simple to install just as long as it’s compatible with your existing deadbolt lock. (it has a <a href="http://www.august.com/compatible-deadbolts.html" target="_blank">compatibility list</a> which tells you whether your lock is compatible. Generally if your deadbolt mount is independent of your door handle, it’s probably compatible, but you may want to double-check to be sure) The installation guide provides an easy-to-understand compatibility diagram.

Unlike many smart locks, which replace your entire or most of your deadbolt lock system, August Smart Lock replaces just the interior thumbturn assembly. It took me 10 minutes to install it.

Installation requires you to (1) unscrew and remove your interior thumbturn assembly, screw on proper mounting plate, (2) put on the proper adapter, (3) slide on the lock and close the clips to secure it.

Based on the kind of lock system you have, you’ll only use 1 of 3 mounting plates and 1 of 3 adapters that it comes with.

Finally, enable the lock on by removing the faceplate (turn it counterclockwise with your palm) and removing the plastic tabs from the batteries; then put the faceplate back on.

Setting up and connecting August Smart Lock to your device is simple as well. Download and open the August app for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/august-smart-lock/id648730592?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.august.app&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a> (<a href="http://august.com/phones" target="_blank">list of compatible phones</a>). It’s evident that the user interface and experience was well thought out.

Once you’ve signed up for an account and signed in, it’ll scan for your lock(s) and guide you through setting it up.

## Features

The August app allows you to easily lock or unlock August Smart Lock with a single tap once you’ve selected the property. It also allows you to manage and add multiple locks and properties. The user interface is well designed and makes using the app a pleasant experience.

!["August app lock and unlock screens"](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8584/15691276443_4236e63e30_c.jpg)

August Smart Lock requires 4 AA batteries (included) and relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to pair with your phone. Since it relies on BLE instead of Wi-Fi, it says it can last almost a year before having to replace its batteries, and during a power outage you’ll still be able to connect to it (assuming your batteries aren’t dead either). You’ll also get a reminder when batteries get low. Since August Smart Lock doesn’t replace your entire lock system, if you forget your phone you can still lock or unlock with your original key from the outside.

Since August Smart Lock only connects via BLE, you can’t control it remotely (not yet at least—<a href="#connect">explanation further down in the review</a>) Alongside the great user experience, it provides some notable features as well.

If your deadbolt isn’t properly aligned with the door frame (you have to push or pull your door to turn your lock and it engage), that’ll still be a problem when locking your door with the August app—you’ll still have to physically push/pull your door while using the app. If that’s the case, you may want to have your door adjusted so its properly aligned.

### Auto-Unlock

Auto-unlock senses when you’re approaching and unlocks the door for you in the background so you don’t have to reach for your phone to unlock August Smart Lock. It uses your phone’s location to determine when you’ve left home and when you’re on your way back.

### Everlock

Everlock automatically relocks your door shortly after you’ve unlocked it (that’s the official description of it in the app). I’ve also read that it also locks the door behind you shortly after you leave the house. I don’t use and haven’t used Everlock (<a href="#usage-and-performance">explanation further down in the review</a>); therefore, I can’t elaborate more on the feature.

### User Management

The app allows you to add users you want to grant access to (the user would have to have a phone compatible with August Smart Lock).

!["August app guest permissions"](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7519/16285208566_28eb349051_c.jpg)

For each user, you can set them as an owner or a guest, and for guests you can grant them permanent, temporary, or recurring/schedule-based access. User access can easily be changed or revoked.

### Apps

It was announced at CES 2015 that <a href="https://nest.com/blog/2015/01/05/what-works-with-nest-at-CES/" target="_blank">August Smart Lock would work with Nest</a>—you can see the temperature at home from the August app, and also allows August Smart Lock to tell Nest Thermostat to start warming or cooling your house when you unlock your door or set Nest Thermostat to Away when you lock your door on your way out.

This is just the first step into a world of possibilities with other smart devices, appliances, and services.

### Connect

<a href="http://blog.august.com/2015/01/07/augustconnect/" target="_blank">August recently announced August Connect</a>, a device that bridges the lock and Wi-Fi and allows you to control your August Smart Lock from anywhere using the app just as long as you have internet connectivity. It’ll set you back an additional $49.99, but there are no monthly or annual fees required.

## Design

Designed by Yves Béhar, August Smart Lock is a gorgeous piece of machinery and an eye-catcher, but it’s also bulkier in person than it appears in photos—it sticks out 2” from the door and is 3” wide in diameter.

Although it looks bulky in person, when turning it manually it doesn’t feel awkward and turns with ease, almost effortless. The face plate tends to become loose and falls off sometimes when you’re unlocking it manually (it may be just the way I’m gripping it, but the same thing happens to my wife).

August Smart Lock comes in 4 flavors from you to choose from: silver, champagne, silver, and red.

An indicator light on the frontplate turns green when it unlocks and red when it locks—there are also accompanying sounds for each.

## Usage and Performance

When August Smart Lock works like it’s designed to work or like you’d expect it to work, it’s fantastic, and on paper the features sound great; unfortunately, in practice the integration lacks harmony and still needs a lot of work.

Connecting to it can range from painless to utter and sheer frustration and resentment, and most of the time it’s the latter. It’s unreliable and usually takes several seconds, sometimes longer, and occasionally never (at least until my patience runs out as I’m staring at my phone waiting for it to connect or until my phone auto locks). A majority of the time I still pull out my keys because it’s faster than waiting for it to connect.

When auto-unlock works, it’s amazing, like thaumaturgy, sorcery, magic, and from personal experience, it works about 60–70% of the time—occasionally at the very attempt to open my door, I’ll find that it’s still locked.

I haven’t used Everlock, but based on the unreliability of auto-unlock, I wouldn’t trust Everlock to automatically lock the door behind me, especially when I’m leaving the house—I can imagine coming home and, to my horror, finding my door unlocked.

With that said, of all the available smart locks out there (like <a href="https://ockitron" target="_blank">Lockitron</a>, <a href="http://www.gojiaccess.com" target="_blank">Goji</a>, <a href="https://www.mykevo.com" target="_blank">Kevo</a> to name a few), August Smart Lock is still my preference and choice.

## Conclusion

August Smart Lock costs $249 and you can order one from <a href="http://august.com" target="_blank">August.com</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/August-Smart-Lock-Bluetooth-Enabled/dp/B00OHY14CS/?tag=jonsuhcom-20" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> (free shipping), or <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/HF6U2LL/A/august-smart-lock?fnode=0001050701" target="_blank">Apple.com</a> or your local Apple store.

August Connect costs $49.99 and you can pre-order it from <a href="http://august.com" target="_blank">August.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/August-Connect-Secure-Remote-Access/dp/B00RPM6UZA/?tag=jonsuhcom-20" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> (free shipping).

Although August Smart Lock still needs a lot of work, I trust it to make the proper software and firmware improvements to smooth out the wrinkles of its unreliability and connection woes. When I pre-ordered it, I knew I was investing in a work-in-progress, and I’ve accepted that in spite of my frustrations.

It’s also possible that August Connect would improve connectivity and reliability since it’ll be a stationary device, and when it’s installed, more than likely rely on August Connect to pair with and control August Smart Lock as opposed to the phone.
