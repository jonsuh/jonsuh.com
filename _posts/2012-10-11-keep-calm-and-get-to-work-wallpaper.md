Inspired by the original *Keep Calm and Carry On* poster, I initially designed this *Keep Calm and Get to Work* motivational wallpaper to keep me in check; however, I thought some of you would be interested in downloading it for yourself so I decided to share it. This wallpaper pack includes the classic red version along with my personal yellow version and each color version comes in formats compatible with standard and widescreen laptops and desktops along with mobile devices (tablets and phones).

Pre-formatted versions for standard, widescreen, iPhone 4S/4, iPhone 5, iPod touch, iPad, Kindle Fire HD, and Galaxy S3 are included in this wallpaper pack. I zipped them up for your downloading convenience. Enjoy it, and get to work!
