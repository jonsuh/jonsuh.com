Back in [February 2015](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html), Google announced that starting April 21 it would be expanding its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. Today is April 21. Here’s some important information on the change and how it could affect your search experience as well as sites you own or manage.

## How does this affect search experience?

This mobile-friendly update only affects searches from mobile devices and from tablets or desktops. However, this is a global change, affecting all languages and locations.

Your search experience should only enhance with this update. Search results will tend to favor mobile-friendly results over those that aren’t.

You’ll also notice a new “Mobile-friendly” tag that accompanies mobile search results.

## How does this affect my sites?

Pages designed only for large screens may see a noticeable decrease in mobile search results. Although Google doesn’t give a specific algorithm on how it calculates mobile-friendliness, legibility and usability on mobile devices are the factors that come into play.

You can check whether or not your site and pages are mobile-friendly using Google’s [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly).

Mobile search results ranking boosts are page-level only, meaning if only part of your site is mobile-friendly, only the mobile-friendly pages will get a ranking boost. However, if your page has been marked as being not mobile-friendly, you’re not doomed—Google updates a page’s mobile-friendliness when it’s crawled and indexed. You can also expedite the process by submitting the link in [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch).

To better keep track of your site and pages that aren’t mobile-friendly, Google recommends you use the [Mobile Usability tool](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-usability) in Google Webmaster Tools—it’ll log all the pages that have mobile-friendliness issues and list specific errors as well.

The impact of this change isn’t immediate and won’t take full effect until Google makes its way to all indexed pages, which should be in a week or so.

Google also posted an official post on [FAQs about the April 21st mobile-friendly update](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/faqs-april-21st-mobile-friendly.html) for more in-depth questions and answers to this change.

## Conclusion

This change may or may not have a direct impact on your site or business; however, the fact that Google is making this move says a lot about how important they see mobile-friendliness.
