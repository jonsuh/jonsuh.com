Welcome to my newly built, digital home. It’s taken me several months to get to this point, and although it’s far from complete, I’m ready to take the covers off and unveil it to you. So without further ado, ta-da 🎉!

## Me

It’s more about me, who I am, the people I love, and the things I’m passionate about and less about fame, fortune, noteriety, and popularity.

This site is a personal reflection of me—I realize one’s online identity is often (whether intentional or not) distorted and fabricated, and by no means is it spot on, but I’ve put forth my best and a genuine effort to portray myself as close to who I really am away from the screen.

I hope that those who know me well can say I’m as genuine on screen as I am away from it.

## Learning experience

These past several months have been a tremendous learning experience, and although it took a few iterations and a lot of deleting and starting over, this site is a direct byproduct of that learning put into practice.

I’ve learned how effective <abbr title="Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS">SMACSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Object-Oriented CSS">OOCSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> are; mobile-first responsive design—the right way; the awesome power and tremendous value of Grunt; how painless Capistrano makes deployments; the usefulness of Bower and how to integrate it into my workflow; and a heck of a lot more.

I’m planning on sharing a lot of what I’ve learned.

## Giving back

I’ll be honest—writing is tough, and writing consistently is even tougher. I want that to change.

As a self-taught designer and developer, I’ve read thousands of articles and tutorials written by other designers and developers for the past 18 years that I’ve been writing HTML. I wouldn’t be where I am today had they not shared their knowledge, expertise and experience.

I often think, “I should write a blog post about [fill in the blank]” but every time I choose not to act on that thought, I’m doing myself a huge disservice and passing up an opportunity to help someone.

I’m embarassed that I’ve written and shared so little when I’ve gained so much from others.

I’ll also be writing and sharing thoughts about life and my faith. It’s time I take writing seriously, and this is where that’s gonna happen.
